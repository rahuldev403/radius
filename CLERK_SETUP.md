# ⚡ URGENT: Clerk Auth Setup Required

Your app has been migrated from Supabase Auth to Clerk Auth to fix all authentication issues.

## 🔑 Get Your Clerk Keys (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://clerk.com and sign up (free)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your keys from the dashboard
4. Update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Replace these placeholder values with your actual Clerk keys:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

5. Deploy to Vercel:
   - Add the same two env vars in Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - Redeploy

## ✅ What Was Fixed

- ✅ Removed broken Supabase OAuth callback
- ✅ Removed custom OTP email verification
- ✅ Installed Clerk for Next.js
- ✅ Updated middleware for auth protection
- ✅ Wrapped app in ClerkProvider
- ✅ Created new AuthModal with Clerk components
- ✅ Created /sign-in and /sign-up routes
- ✅ Updated account page to use Clerk
- ✅ Kept Supabase for database only

## 🚀 Features You Get With Clerk

- Google OAuth (works immediately)
- Email/password auth
- Magic links
- Phone verification
- Multi-factor auth
- Session management
- All handled by Clerk - no custom code needed!

## 📝 After Adding Keys

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Your auth will work perfectly on both localhost and Vercel!
