### 3. **Automated Reminder System**

#### API Endpoint (`app/api/reminders/route.ts`)

- **Database Table**: `booking_reminders`
  - Fields: `booking_id`, `reminder_type`, `scheduled_for`, `sent`

#### Reminder Schedule

For each booking, three reminders are automatically scheduled:

2. **1 hour before** - Preparation reminder
3. **15 minutes before** - Last-minute alert

## üìä Database Schema Requirements

### Tables Needed

```sql
-- booking_reminders table
CREATE TABLE booking_reminders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  reminder_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- '24h', '1h', '15min'
  scheduled_for TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX idx_reminders_scheduled ON booking_reminders(scheduled_for, sent);
```

### Bookings Table (should already exist)

```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  service_id INTEGER REFERENCES services(id),
  seeker_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  end_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_provider ON bookings(provider_id, start_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_seeker ON bookings(seeker_id, start_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);
```

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install sonner date-fns

### 2. Create Database Tables

### 3. Set Up Cron Job (Production)
