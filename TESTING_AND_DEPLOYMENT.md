## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Application

```powershell
npm run build
```

This will:

- Check for TypeScript errors
- Optimize production build
- Generate static pages
- Create optimized bundles

### 3. Test Locally in Production Mode

```powershell
npm run start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and test all features.

---

## Database Configuration

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for database to initialize (~2 minutes)

### Step 2: Run Database Schema

1. Open Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` file
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify all tables created successfully

### Step 3: Enable PostGIS Extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

### Step 4: Test Database Functions

```sql
-- Test get_services_nearby function
SELECT * FROM get_services_nearby(40.7128, -74.0060, 5000);

-- Test average rating function
SELECT get_user_average_rating('user-uuid-here');

-- Test credit balance function
SELECT get_user_credits('user-uuid-here');
```

### Step 5: Verify RLS Policies

```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- All tables should have rowsecurity = true
```

---

## Environment Variables

### Local Development (`.env.local`)

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Email Configuration (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key-here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourapp.com

# Optional: SMS Configuration (Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### Production (Vercel/Netlify)

Add the same variables in your deployment platform's environment settings.

**Important:** Never commit `.env.local` to version control!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Map Not Loading

**Symptoms:** White screen where map should be, console error: "Map container not found"

**Solutions:**

```typescript
// Ensure dynamic import with ssr: false
const Map = dynamic(() => import("@/components/map"), {
  ssr: false,
});

// Add key prop to force remount
<Map key={`${userLocation}-${view}`} />;
```

---

### Issue 2: Popup Click Errors

**Symptoms:** "Cannot read properties of null" when clicking inside map popup

**Solution:**

```typescript
// Add stopPropagation to all clickable elements in popup
<Card onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>
  <Button
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      handleAction();
    }}
  >
    Click Me
  </Button>
</Card>
```

---

### Issue 3: Realtime Not Working

**Symptoms:** Messages not appearing in real-time, need to refresh

**Solutions:**

```typescript
// 1. Check Supabase Realtime enabled in project settings
// 2. Verify channel subscription
const channel = supabase
  .channel("chat_room")
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    {
      event: "INSERT",
      schema: "public",
      table: "messages",
    },
    (payload) => {
      console.log("New message:", payload);
    }
  )
  .subscribe((status) => {
    console.log("Subscription status:", status);
  });

// 3. Check RLS policies allow SELECT on messages table
```

---

### Issue 4: Video Call Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Blank screen, Jitsi not loading

**Solutions:**

```typescript
// 1. Check if Jitsi script loaded
console.log("JitsiMeetExternalAPI" in window); // Should be true

// 2. Verify container element exists
const container = document.getElementById("jitsi-container");
console.log("Container found:", !!container);

// 3. Check browser console for CORS errors
// 4. Ensure HTTPS in production (Jitsi requires secure context)
```

---

### Issue 5: Geolocation Permission Denied

**Symptoms:** Location not saving, map shows default location

**Solutions:**

```typescript
// 1. Handle permission denial gracefully
if (navigator.permissions) {
  navigator.permissions.query({ name: "geolocation" }).then((result) => {
    if (result.state === "denied") {
      // Show manual location input
      toast.error("Location permission denied. Please enter manually.");
    }
  });
}

// 2. Provide manual location input as fallback
<Input
  placeholder="Enter your address"
  // Geocode address to coordinates
/>;
```

---

### Issue 6: Build Errors

**Symptoms:** `npm run build` fails with TypeScript errors

**Solutions:**

```powershell
# Check for type errors
npm run lint

# Fix common issues:
# 1. Add proper types to all props
# 2. Handle null/undefined cases
# 3. Add 'use client' directive to client components
# 4. Fix any vs specific types
```

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. Set Up Monitoring

**Vercel:** Built-in analytics available
**Sentry:** Error tracking (recommended)

```powershell
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

### 2. Database Backups

**Supabase:** Automatic daily backups on Pro plan
**Manual Backup:**

```sql
-- Export database
pg_dump your_database > backup.sql

-- Restore database
psql your_database < backup.sql
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

```sql
-- Monitor query performance
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE total_exec_time > 1000
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC;

-- Check cache hit ratio
SELECT
  sum(heap_blks_read) AS heap_read,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) AS heap_hit,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) AS ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;
-- Ratio should be > 0.90
```
