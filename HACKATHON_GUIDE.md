- "Geospatial queries with PostGIS"
- "WebSocket-based chat system"
- "Advanced animations with GSAP"
- "Full TypeScript for type safety"

### User Experience

- "Multiple revenue streams possible"

## 🔥 Handling Judge Questions

### "How does location tracking work?"

> "We use the browser's Geolocation API for user location, store it in PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension, and use spatial queries to find services within the specified radius. It's efficient and privacy-respecting."

### "What about privacy concerns?"

> "Users control their visibility radius. We only show approximate locations on the map, not exact addresses. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using Supabase's security features."

### "How is this different from existing platforms?"

> "Unlike broad platforms like Fiverr or LinkedIn, Radius focuses on hyperlocal connections. The key differentiator is the radius-based search and community-first approach. Plus, our real-time features and stunning UI set us apart."

### "What was the biggest technical challenge?"

> "Implementing efficient geospatial queries was challenging. We used PostGIS with custom SQL functions to calculate distances and filter services. The real-time chat with conflict-free booking also required careful state management."

### "How would you monetize this?"

> "Multiple streams: premium subscriptions for advanced features, service fees on bookings, promoted listings for providers, and our existing credit system. The community aspect creates natural viral growth."

### "Is this scalable?"

> "Absolutely! Supabase handles millions of operations, PostGIS is industry-standard for geospatial data, and our Next.js architecture is production-ready. We use edge functions and could add caching layers as needed."
