# Fixes Applied âœ…

## 1. Profile Location Update - Toast Notifications âœ¨

### Problem:

- Location update didn't show success notification
- No visual feedback after updating location

### Solution:

- Added **sonner toast notifications**
- Success toast: "Location Updated! Your location has been updated successfully."
- Error toast: "Failed to update location"
- Instant visual feedback on every location update

### How It Works:

```typescript
toast.success("Location Updated!", {
  description: "Your location has been updated successfully.",
});
```
