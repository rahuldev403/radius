## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration

Execute the SQL migration to create the incentive system:

```bash
# Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `supabase-migrations/incentive-system.sql`
4. Paste and execute the SQL
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables

After running the migration, verify these tables exist:

- `user_credits` - Tracks credit balances
- `credit_transactions` - Records all transactions
- `badges` - Defines available badges
- `badge_assignments` - Tracks earned badges

## Credit System

### How Credits Work

1. **Starting Balance**: New users receive **100 credits** automatically upon signup
2. **Earning Credits**: Users earn credits through:

   - Platform bonuses
   - Completing bookings
   - Community contributions
   - Referrals

3. **Spending Credits**: Users can give credits to:

   - Service providers (tips/rewards)
   - Other community members
   - Community project donations

4. **Credit Stats Tracked**:
   - **Balance** - Current available credits
   - **Total Earned** - All credits received from platform
   - **Total Received** - Credits given by other users (determines badge tier)
   - **Total Spent** - Credits given to others

  u.avatar_url,
  uc.total_received,
  COUNT(ba.id) as badge_count
FROM user_credits uc
JOIN profiles u ON u.id = uc.user_id
LEFT JOIN badge_assignments ba ON ba.user_id = uc.user_id
GROUP BY u.full_name, u.avatar_url, uc.total_received
